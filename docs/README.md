# Introduction to Cloud Migration

This tutorial is designed to show you with a concrete example how to perform a migration to the public cloud.  
In this tutorial, we will migrate a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application progressively to the cloud, leveraging more and more on different managed services the further we go.  
Throughout the tutorial, the functionality of the application will not change, it will just become more reliable and less costly.

This tutorial guides you through the following steps:

- Manually deploy an application on EC2 Instances [here](./iaas.md)
- Automatically deploy an application on EC2 Instances [here](./cicd_artifacts.md)
- Make use of a managed database service [here](./iaas_w_aurora.md)
- Containerize an application and you a container service [here](./docker.md)
- Use a managed runtime environment and make the application serverless [here](./lambda.md)
